## Programming

### The beginning

The first programming language I learned was C++ at my second year of high school.

I later switched over to Python for an assignment we had where we could use any programming language, and we could make whatever we wanted.

I decided that I wanted to make a basic login-system, it was pretty bad, but it was a start, it was what led me to make [PythonOS](https://github.com/dannyboy9934/PythonOS), which still is pretty bad
