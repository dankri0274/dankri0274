## Programming

### The beginning

The first programming language I learned was C++ at my second year of high school.

My first program in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Hello world" << endl;
	cout << "This is my C++ program" << endl;
	cout << "Press any key to continue..." << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

I later switched over to Python for an assignment we had where we could use any programming language, and we could make whatever we wanted.

I decided that I wanted to make a basic login-system, it was pretty bad, but it was a start, it was what led me to make [PythonOS](https://github.com/dannyboy9934/PythonOS)

- **Python**
- **C** (Some experience).
